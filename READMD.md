# widgets

This is the code from the **eosio** smart contracts [[course]](https://training.eos.io/courses/take/smart-contracts-101/lessons/19190935-toy-haus-codealong-2). In teh video they use **toy haus** but I like the word **widget** too much. Want to use **acme** sometime too.

**Widgets** will demonstrate a basic EOSIO smart contract, including

- Define contract actions
- Define a table
- Perform read/write/remove operations on the table


## Tech Stack

I am using Ubuntu 18.04, EOS Studio using v2.0.6, v2.0.0 locally.



## History

Good milestones.

* FirstCommit - Basic hello style functions, all three working.
