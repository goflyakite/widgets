# widgets

This is the code from the **eosio** smart contracts [[course]](https://training.eos.io/courses/take/smart-contracts-101/lessons/19190935-toy-haus-codealong-2). In teh video they use **toy haus** but I like the word **widget** too much. Want to use **acme** sometime too.

**Widgets** will demonstrate a basic EOSIO smart contract, including

- Define contract actions
- Define a table
- Perform read/write/remove operations on the table


## Setup & Notes

You'll need an account named **widgetboss**
I find that sometimes changes don't take fully after compile, so I log out of EOSStudio and come back in and it's fine. Tested this by finding out that a change was not taking - so used the original ACTION name and adding an "x" on the end - and that would fail.



## Tech Stack

I am using Ubuntu 18.04, EOS Studio using v2.0.6, v2.0.0 locally.



## History

Good milestones.

* d5c5e96 - Basic hello style functions, all three working.
* 6140b99 - Working first cut of widget code.
